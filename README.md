Hey there! :v:, my name is Ángel, I am a self-taught Full Stack Developer :boy: from México (the land of the taco).

In the Frontend, I'm the React.js or React Native guy :sunglasses:, and currently, I am trying to mix them using React Native Web (it is kinda hard :dizzy_face:) :thumbsup:.

In the Backend, I found really interesting how GraphQL works, and when we talk about DBMS, I'm with, and I quote, "The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database" PostgreSQL :elephant:.

My favorit operating system is Gentoo Linux :heart_eyes: (except when I have to compile LibreOffice or Node.js :broken_heart:) and the command line is my best friend :metal:.

I'm just starting, but, if you are like me, and do not know where to start (I've been there), don't hesitate in reach me :wink:, maybe I could help you (or maybe you could help me :satisfied:).
